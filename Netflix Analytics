In this file, I am querying a database that holds information on Netflix content.

/* How many movie titles are in this database? */

select count(*) from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" where type='Movie';

/* When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? */

select max(date(date_added)) from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"; 

/* List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. */

select "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info".title
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
order by title asc;

/* Who was the director for the movie Bright Star? */

select people.director, titles.title
From "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON titles.show_id = people.show_id
Where titles.title = 'Bright Star';

/* What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? */

select title, release_year 
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
where type = 'Movie' order by release_year asc LIMIT 1;
